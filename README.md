# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Overview
This project uses a Model-Predictive-Controller to drive a vehicle around a track using waypoint navigation.  The MPC model uses inference over a discrete number of timesteps to accurately (and smoothly) drive the vehicle around the track.  To account for latency in the solvers' computation time, the current state is forward projected using a global kinematic motion model to update the state prior to differentiation.

## Optimisation
The model is optimised using automatic-differentiation (IpOpt library) using the following cost function:
 - Interpolation of states (i.e. state[t+1] - state[t])
 - Actuator loss (acceleration and throttle)
 - Reference state loss (cross-track, orientation and velocity errors)

 The number of discrete timesteps used in optimisation is 2N + 1, which in this case is 11.  This accounts for the forward projection of the initial state and the number of datapoints available at each prediction step.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) == 0.14, but the master branch will probably work just fine
  * Follow the instructions in the [uWebSockets README](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/blob/master/README.md) to get setup for your platform. You can download the zip of the appropriate version from the [releases page](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/releases). Here's a link to the [v0.14 zip](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets/archive/v0.14.0.zip).
  * If you have MacOS and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed you can just run the ./install-mac.sh script to install this.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt --with-openblas`
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/) or the [Github releases](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases) page.
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/releases).
